          , translates the GenAI hype cycle into a measurable picture of how
          state and territory governments are actually responding. I built a
          public-information benchmark that scores all states and territories on
          concrete adoption signals - employee guidance, training, sandboxes,
          pilots, governance structures, and transparency - then paired the
          index with a policy roadmap for what leaders should do next.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The headline result was stark: most states scored below 50/100, and
            only a small handful cleared 80, suggesting the U.S. state landscape
            is early, uneven, and often opaque.
          </strong>{" "}
          The accompanying write-up turns the data into a practical playbook:
          standardize workforce guidance and training, safely enable consumer
          tools, run measurable pilots (sandbox or enterprise), publish action
          plans, stand up permanent AI capacity, and lead with transparency so
          constituents can see what’s happening and why.

          This report captures the work I led to stand up a brand-new
          congressional office from zero and benchmark its first 100 days of
          operation. I helped design the office’s internal systems, set early
          priorities, and define what success would look like before we opened
          the doors. From there, I worked across functions to make those goals
          real: including pulling expertise from our legislative,
          communications, operations, and constituent services teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led the collection and verification of office-wide metrics,
          identified and summarized qualitative and quantitative wins, designed
          the final report, and coordinated its release to media and
          stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this was a reflection of the work I led to set up and
          operationalize the new congressional office.

          My senior thesis is a qualitative honors project analyzing the
          structural decline of local journalism in Australia and its
          implications for democratic accountability, labor, and media policy.{" "}
          <strong>
            Drawing on 17 in-depth interviews with current and former
            journalists, editors, newsroom owners, and industry experts, the
            study examines how economic contraction, platform dominance,
            newsroom consolidation, and emerging technologies, including
            generative AI, are reshaping local and regional news ecosystems.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I designed and executed the research end-to-end, including literature
          review across journalism studies and political economy; interview
          recruitment; transcription verification; flexible qualitative coding;
          and thematic analysis. The project situates journalism as a public
          good and interrogates why market-based and regulatory interventions,
          such as platform bargaining codes, advertising subsidies, and public
          broadcasting, have produced mixed or unsustainable outcomes. Key
          findings include persistent career precarity among journalists,
          widespread skepticism toward platform regulation, limited awareness of
          AI’s longer-term effects, and the absence of policy consensus on
          preserving local news.

          This project used geographic information systems (GIS) and
          quantitative analysis to examine electric vehicle access,
          infrastructure, and access. I worked with spatial datasets covering
          population, infrastructure, and policy variables to identify where EV
          adoption is accelerating, and where structural gaps remain.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role focused on data cleaning, spatial joins, and statistical
          interpretation. I translated raw geographic data into interpretable
          findings through maps, charts, and written analysis. The project
          culminates in a clear conclusion: at the time of publication, income
          and racial identity do not have a significant spatial relationship to
          EV charging infrastructure.

        <SectionTitle>Key Takeaways</SectionTitle>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Race and income:</strong> regression results indicate very
            weak relationships between charger proximity and both income and
            race at the national and Wayne County levels (all R² values close to
            zero).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Geography and policy:</strong> charger gaps appear regional
            and urban–rural, with higher density in states that prioritize EV
            policy and large charger deserts in parts of the South, Midwest, and
            Great Plains.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Next research steps:</strong> county-level analysis and a
            single local case study limit conclusions; future work should
            examine tract-level national data and rural access over time.

          I founded and led the Fulbright Taiwan ChatGPT Lab, the first

          At Boehringer Cares, I helped lead a full rebrand including visual

          impact: primarily internally, but also externally.

          I led data collection and synthesis to inform the rebrand, then
          translated those insights into a new website through working with the
          user experience team and visual identity through collaboration with
          the brand strategy team. I was deeply involved in both strategy and
          aesthetics, ensuring the final product was coherent, modern, and
          aligned with new long-term goals.

        <p>
          At the end of my rotation with the sustainable development team, I
          authored an internal report summarizing the state of health access
          within the company, getting everyone on the same page for the first
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another major component of this work involved collaboration with the
          Sustainable Development Excellence (SDX) program through the
          University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business. I supported program
          operations while ensuring that external partnerships aligned with the
          company’s evolving health access strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SDX program, thanks in part to my strategic positioning of the
          program as a leader in the field, was selected for a Brandon Hall
          Group Award.
        </p>
